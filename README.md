# Classification-using-KNN
Main Tasks:
- Pre-processing and exploratory data analysis using scatter plots and box plots
- Classification using sklearn's KNN classifier
- Plot train and test errors in terms of k to find the most suitable k*
- Evaluate performance by calculating the confusion matrix, true positive rate, true negative rate, precision and F-1 score when k=k*
- Plot learning curve to understand how the performance changes with change in size of training data
- Understand how the performance varies with different distance metrics:
  - Euclidean
  - Manhattan
  - Chebyshev
  - Minkowski
  - Mahalanobis
